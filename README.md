# Tide-Pool
**This repository contains the code to run the Tide Pool
for the marine lab biology research group.**

This code controls the pumping system for both the tide pool and the stingray
lagoon. There are currently two pumps that when one is on, it empties the tank
it is in filling the other tank.
